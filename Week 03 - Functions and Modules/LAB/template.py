# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Write a function called status_of(percent) that returns "OVER LIMIT"
#    (100% or more), "WARNING" (90% or more), or "OK" (anything else).
#
#    Typical and above: also write check(value, limit) that returns the
#    difference and the percentage as two values - do not print anything
#    inside it, only calculate and return.
#
#    Excellent: also write print_report(label, value, limit, difference,
#    percent, status) that does ALL of the printing below - nothing outside
#    it should contain a print() of its own.
#
#    Give each function a one-line docstring saying what it does.

# your function(s) go here

def status_of(percent):
	"""Return the status for a percentage of failed attempts."""
	if percent >= 100:
		return "OVER LIMIT"
	if percent >= 90:
		return "WARNING"
	return "OK"

def check(failed_logins, total_attempts):
    free = total_attempts - failed_logins
    percent = (failed_logins / total_attempts) * 100
    return free, percent


# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 2. Ask for your three values.
#
#    - the first is TEXT      (a name, a hostname, an IP)  -> no conversion needed
#    - the second is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#    - the third  is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())

source_IP = input("Enter source IP: ")    # replace with an input() call
failed_logins = float(input("Enter failed logins: "))     # replace with an input() call, converted
total_attempts = float(input("Enter total attempts: "))     # replace with an input() call, converted


# ================================================================== PROCESS
# 3. Work out the difference, the percentage, and the status.
#
#    Threshold : call status_of() to get the status. Work out the
#                difference and percentage inline, not in a function.
#    Typical   : call check() to get the difference and percentage instead.

free, percent = check(failed_logins, total_attempts)
status = status_of(percent)

# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 4. Print the report.
#
#    Threshold : the three values you were given, plus status, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : call print_report() instead of printing directly here, and
#                wrap sections 2-4 in a loop so you can check as many records
#                as you like in one run - type "quit" as the label to stop.
#                Keep count of how many came back OVER LIMIT and print that
#                once, after the loop ends.

# ==========================================================================
# 5. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and note the error (do not fix it yet)
#    [ ] Check every function does one job - if a function both calculates
#        and prints, split it
